Project status
-----------------
Release: Under Development

Summary
-----------------
The idea of making application screens configurable, moving around from probably first to the second or moving the last to the second to the last seems to be a problem that can't be solved. The idea behind this project is to create such framework and making it configurable into the extent that there will be less or no code changes on the actual FX Controller.

Technologies / Components
-------------------------
1. Java Annotations (Java 8)
	- Java Annotations will make it easy to track down Screen Properties
2. Database Tables (Derby)
	- The annotated properties will be linked into column values in tables
